%brute-force solution to TSP--runs VERY slowly
%specialized for 10-cities tour

%compute all solutions exhaustively and save a list of the trip costs
%for any circle trip, may arbitrarily assume starting from city 1 and
%ending at city 1--all such trips have an equivalency starting at city 2
%and ending at city 2, etc.  Therefore, don't need to recalculate these.
%Also, if the costs are symmetric (cost from A to B = cost from B to A)
%then don't need to compute reverse-order trips.  E.g., can enforce that
%2nd city visited ranges from 2 to Ncities/2, and next to last city visited
%starts at Ncities/2+1 and ranges to Ncities--cuts number of candidates in
%half.
